### JavaScript Library: React

React is my frontend library of choice. I enjoy developing in React, mostly because it's what I know best and use most often.

### State Management: Zustand

I chose to use Zustand because this is such a small project. I've only used this library once before, but I love using it for concept projects where the most important thing is efficiency. Zustand is extremely lightweight and works well for these types of use cases.

### Style: SCSS

I enjoy SCSS because of the nesting capabilities. Until CSS fully implements this, I think SCSS is where I'll be.

### Testing: React Testing Library

This repository could use some more tests, but I'm happy testing with React Testing Library. I think it allows the developer to write tests in a way that better resembles what a human sees or interacts with on the screen than when using Enzyme.
